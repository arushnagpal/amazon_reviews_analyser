The idle was very rough and noisy, and the engine wasn't as smooth as it should have been in general, especially at lower engine speeds.  The problem was so bad that the engine would almost stall at idle after first being started.I tried Lucas \"Upper Cyclinder Lubricant and Injector Cleaner\", and it didn't seem to help at all.  Then I put a full 20-oz bottle of Chevron Techron through the fuel tank, and it also seemed to do nothing.  In each case, the product was used as directed, and the car was driven until the fuel level was very low.  That is, I didn't refill the fuel tank and dilute the product in either case.  In the past, I've also used other brands of fuel system and fuel injector cleaners, including Gumout and STP.  None of these products seemed to have the slightest effect.Finally, and extremely skeptical, I tried Sea Foam Motor Treatment.  I put a full 16-oz bottle in the fuel tank after filling up.  The improvement was dramatic and immediate.  The engine ran much more smoothly and quietly than before.  The engine no longer idled like a diesel farm tractor.  I was extremely surprised, but still skeptical, because I wasn't sure if it had actually cleaned anything, or if it was simply helping because it was being burned with the fuel.  So, I withheld judgment until the fuel tank had been driven to near-empty and refilled, meaning that the amount of Sea Foam left in the fuel would be negligible.This was no placebo effect.  Even after refueling, the car ran much better than it did before.  It now idles more nicely than my Hyundai, which still seems bizarre to me.  I am extremely pleased, which doesn't happen often, trust me.  I'll be putting a can of Sea Foam Motor Treatment through my fuel tanks before every oil change from now on.My other car, a Hyundai Sonata, had an annoying ticking sound when it would idle, especially when cold.  I would have described the sound as a \"lifter tick\", but I'm not sure what it was--a sticking valve?  I don't know; I'm no mechanic.  I added the recommended amount of Sea Foam to the crankcase, and the sound went away immediately, or nearly so.  I've since changed the oil in that car, and the sound has not returned.Some people criticize Sea Foam based on its age.  I find these criticisms ridiculous--as if \"older\" equates with \"worse\".  Do these people ever address the actual chemistry of the product, or provide actual reasons for their disapproval?  No, they just complain about how long it's been around.Sea Foam made me a believer.

For about the past 6 months, I have noticed about a 2mpg drop in fuel economy.A couple of my friends have used this stuff and claimed success, so I gave it a shot.  I added a can to the fuel tank, and half a can each to the crankcase and air intake.  Let it sit and drove it around.  It smoked like crazy as promised.Now, anecdotally, I do think it smoothed out my idle and I haven't had a hard start.  But, there is nothing I can quantify, and I am not sure that the improvements are not all psychological.  I think my truck runs better if I wax it.  My use also coincided with the end of winter, so the operating temperatures can account for the improvements, too.  I did not see an improvement in mpg.So, if this is where my story ended, I'd say give it a go.  If it works, great.  If not, you didn't lose too much.BUT...The second tank after using this I got a o2 sensor code and had to replace a downstream sensor.  To be fair, the truck has 100k, and this could just be the natural lifespan of the sensor.  Since I had already noticed a drop in mpg, the sensor was likely on its way out.  At the same time, I think it is rather interesting that it failed less than 300 miles after using this product when I've been driving around with the diminished mpg for several thousand miles.  My personal belief is that the big blast of smoke just pushed a failing sensor over the edge.So, no, I won't use this stuff again.

The past 15 years, the car has always passed smog with flying colors (usually, all the numbers are 0 or close to it). This year, the car passed everything fine with the same record, except NOx at 15 mph. Reading online said that this is the place to fail if your car is going to fail. Prior years, the number was 50, with a max limit of 480 or so. This year, it went up to 780.So, I bought seafoam and, unlike a lot of other people, my car hardly smoked at all. I baby my car usually (short shift, cruise at 60-65, easy on the gas and brake and clutch) all in the name of gas mileage. With only an intake, exhaust, and headers, I average into the mid 40's for gas mileage average, when the EPA for the car is 25/33.I'm not sure if this is something to do with my car getting old and the Catylitic converter is getting bad, but after Seafoam, the car registered a barely pass of 460 out of 480 max.For those of you who wonder, I added the seafoam through the brake booster vacuum line. This, from what I have been told, is good for a quick fix and to pass smog. I later dumped the rest of the can (2/3 left) into the gas tank. Its hard to notice, but I believe the car idles a bit easier (no gushing kind of noises). Could be cleaning the injectors.Whatever the case, I passed smog and plan on using this the next time I go in for a smog 2 years from now.I read a lot of forums online and there is great debate over seafoam. It took me a while to buy it, but it worked. 5 Stars! Worst that happens is you put it into a car that is held together by carbon deposits and your car leaks. If you car leaks oil already, or you believe it has the possibility to with engine cleaning, don't buy this. But if you have high NOx or other figures, this is is a good buy to pass smog.

I put my first bottle (about half of it) in my ATV which was running a little rough. Threw some in the fuel tank and then sprayed some (with a spray bottle) directly into the carb while running. Let it sit for 5 minutes and repeated. It instantly ran smoother and had better throttle response. I thought okay, not bad for a quick &#34;miracle in a bottle&#34;. So i went over to my weed wacker which would run like crap at anything over half throttle. I figured if this stuff could fix my weed wacker than it has my approval.  I added a little to the fuel and repeated the same process (spraying in the carb and letting it sit twice). It smoked a ton but ran like it was straight out of the box new. SOLD! I love this stuff.Long story short I bought three more bottles and put it in both of my vehicles, my snowblower, generator, leaf blower, lawn mower, outboard mower, and anything else with an engine. Everything runs like it is brand new. Forget bringing your stuff to get fixed by a mechanic. For cheap money up front you can do a little preventative maintenance and stabilize, clean the gunk out of your machines, and keep them running smoothly.When I put it in my vehicles, I threw a third of the bottle in the fuel tank, SLOOOOWLY (READ SLOWLY) dripped a third of the bottle in my vacuum line, and may toss the last third in the oil right before my next oil change. If you throw it in the oil you need to change the oil and filter within 100 miles or it will be bad for the engine.

Oil might not lubricate as well (or at all) if the clearances betweenbearings are so wide (without the deposits in place) that it can't reach them.  Take care whenusing this product, and do so responsibly.Better idea: run 20% Marvel Mystery oil in your crankcase (use 1 of each 5 quarts as MMO), add 4 or 5ounces of it (per 10 gallons) to the fuel, and pour some down the carburetor (or into PCV valve or acarefully-selected vacuum line) ) once the car is started.  Don't go crazy with the amount you pour intothe engine directly.  Run it in a new oil change: use cheap (but new) oil.  Use a cheap (but decent)  oilfilter like a Fram ExtraGuard [the Orange Can].  Run for 2-4 weeks.  Change oil again with a good filter(Motorcraft are my favorites but Purolator and Mobil 1 are great as well) and decent oil (preferably synthetic)and watch the crap drain out with the oil/Marvel Mystery Oil combo.  Continue to run good oils and filtersfrom then on, and perhaps repeat this procedure every few years or as you believe it necessary.Seafoam is a far more aggressive crankcase cleaner (flush) solution which fewer cars are inbad enough condition to require.

I've used their leather cleaner, leather protectant, and 2-in-1 leather protectant with great success, so I had high expectations for the Vinylex.The best way to describe Vinylex is that it is almost like 303 Aerospace Protectant, which I have used for over 12 years with good success. Vinylex is a white milky liquid that is applied to plastic and rubber to protect it from UV radiation and degradation. It's not supposed to contain silicone which can dry out dash board materials.I've used the Vinylex on polycarbonate, plastic car trim, dashboards, steering wheels, center consoles, and the plastic body panels on my Ducati Monster 696. It dries cleanly leaving no greasy residue or smell. There are no streaks either. However, I don't recommend using it directly on the grip area of a steering wheel or any other surface where friction is required for safety purposes. It does get somewhat slippery even when dry.The directions indicate to shake well, so there's probably some ingredients that settle. However, I recommend covering the nozzle with a cloth when you shake it because some product does come out. I just use old (but clean) cotton socks for applying the Vinylex. The best part about Vinylex is that there seems to be no off-gassing after applying it on the dashboard. When I tried Armor All products and even 303, it tended to leave a filmy residue on the inside of the windshield as it dried out. The 303 also had an odd smell, whereas Vinylex is almost totally odor-free. I also used Vinylex on the EPDM rubber door seals on my cars.Overall: 5/5 stars, highly recommended.

He suggested to use this stuff and to NEVER use anything by Armor All because the greasy film produces a greenhouse effect, trapping all the rays the sun puts out and basically cooks the plastic, causing premature aging, cracking, etc.. I foolishly started using Armor All about 3 years ago because it made the plastic in my car look really nice and had a deep, rich black color it was starting to lack. But then I gave Vinylex a try and once I removed the Armor All that was previously applied, I noticed that my circular air vents actually turned a little white. I can only assume the AA caused that. So I stripped all my interior plastic of the AA and used Vinylex and, depending on how much you apply, leaves a really nice matte finish with a slight bit of sheen, but with no glare in the windshield. The AA wipes I used, even if I wrung them out, still left a highly reflective shine on the dash.The best way I found to apply Vinylex is to take a good quality microfiber towel, fold it and then spray about 3 good squirts, rub it in and that should cover a whole door panel with ease. Then switch to a clean side of that microfiber and kinda wipe off or buff some of the wetness you may get on the plastic. Also use it on interior weather stripping where the doors shut-- mine were looking spotty with water and almost chalky, simply because I never bothered to clean them. The Vinylex made them look dark black and brand new. I have access to this stuff because the Toyota dealer I work at sells it and a lot of it. I've honestly never seen it anywhere else.

U am here to say otherwise.The first is someone stated they are having issues with this sealant causing swirls. No liquid, in any way, will ever put swirls in a car. The one product that wi is the applicator you are using to apply the product. Always make sure you have a good microfiber or foam applicator.Second, and the one people have the most difficulty with, is how hard it is to wipe this off. This is a wipe on wipe off product that applies very very thinly to your car. The proper application is to dampen your applicator with water, put some klasse in a small spray bottle and spritz it on the applicator. Then apply to a small section and immediately wipe off. The longer you wait, the harder it will be to remove.This stuff is meant to last and it does. Traditional waxes would have to be applied on the entire car and then you would wait and then wipe off. This is a sealant, it requires little time to cure or adhere to your paint.I use this and a 33oz bottle I figure will last me at least 5 years, applying one coat twice a year on a mid size sedan.Klasse is very slick. After a rainfall, the only thing that is wet afterwards is the trunk and center of the roof, as those are the only flat parts.It also gives off a great shine and lasts me 6 months with washing twice a week.If there are some spots you missed and the product has dried on or is too hard to remove, simply apply more and rub off.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "PLEASE READ: EASY REMOVAL", "unixReviewTime": 1358121600, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2013"}

When you are ready for it to shine, get this product out.Get yourself a velcro &#34;pad holder&#34; that fits in your palm.  Attached a round 4&#34; pad to the velcro holder.  Apply just 1-3 drops from the jug on the pad.  That is all.  Then do about a 2' x 2' section.  Put it on very lightly.  Oh... DO IT IN THE SHADE!!  This product dries as hard as a rock.  If you put it on heavy, you may get frustrated.  But there is no need.Do one fender at a time.  Put on very lightly.  Wipe off before going to next fender/door whatever.  Just 3 drops will do a whole door.  This product goes a long way.  You have a tendency to put it on heavy to start because you want to &#34;see a haze&#34; to wipe off.  You don't need a heavy haze.  Just a light one.  Then BUFF with a soft double folded cloth.  If you put it on LIGHTLY, it will only take light buffing.  If you mistakenly put it on heavy, you may have a tendency to RUB IT HARDER --- BUT THAT CAUSES SWIRL MARKS from even a soft towel thread.  So If you put it on heavy,let it dry.  Then overspray with a little Quick Detailer spray (any brand you prefer) and then wipe.  The heavy haze comes off.  You can also spray the Quick Detailer on a rag first and then wipe off the haze.

I put it on in minutes after delivery and warming a little, and it is not moving; low 80's outside today but likely over 110F in the car. I do not have sweaty hands and it does not look like color came off. It is smooth leather and is dyed black, much like belts and shoes, which can rub off on contact (belts do after repeated hand-contact and probably stain the inside of belt loops without our knowing). For those with sweaty hands get a rubber-cover with grips (stinky) or vinyl (slippery) but neither are very durable in hot cars; you won't be as happy with the comfort unless it is leather. Non-leather will smell toxic or be slippery, but it will not bleed color. If your hands sweat they may slip on vinyl or smooth rubber. This product has a great grip and feel and leathery smell.There is an inner rubber-sleeve )non-smelly) that prevents the cover from moving. I set the product in the sun for about 5 minutes and it made it ply-able enough to work it on. I recommend starting with the center-most seam on top of a straight wheel(there are 3 seams at roughly 12,4,8 O'clock), carefully work the outer edge over the wheel and down both sides evenly (the first 3/4's is easy), use patience and care, then roll the edge into position. If it is off-center it cannot be slid sideways. Take it off carefully and begin again with it more centered and work each side evenly; a little here, a little there. Do not put this on cold or stretch without warming; it can damage/crack/tear cold leather.I placed this on a 15\" 2008 Chevy Aveo5 steering wheel (do measure your wheel diameter before ordering). The only con to these types of covers is they cannot wrap the inside, so the fingers feel the outer edges of the cover; in this case it is smooth, rolled, and well stitched and I have gotten used to it. It is probably made in China at this price but it looks and feels like good quality. I recommend this and would choose to buy again and recommend to a friend. I also recommend a little leather conditioner on this, much like one would use on leather car interiors. It is smooth leather, not suade or roughened.In 'the old days' I bought wrapped 'stinky' vinyl, and used vinyl to thread through holes and wrap around the cover with tension (still available) and it filled the inner part of the wheel. It was difficult and time-consuming, and, the vinyl strings eventually breaks. I recommend this 'new and improved' version. Rubber and vinyl degrades in heat and UV. Did you know that wonderful 'new car smell' is highly carcinogenic, expecially when hot, and all the glue they use on carpeting and interior fabric, also. This has been well known and accepted for over 50 years but it sells cars. FYI.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Really Excellent Quality", "unixReviewTime": 1377216000, "reviewTime": "08 23, 2013"}

R. \"Monkihead\"", "helpful": [16, 18], "reviewText": "Like others I have found the cover to fall short in the sizing department. I understand it's leather and unlike a comparable vinyl based product, sizing is critical because unlike vinyl, leather can't be stretched too much for a fit. This limits you to a steering wheel that is within 5mm of the product's diameter. I have tried fitting this on two steering wheels. First on my F250 and it was literally impossible. The diameter of the cover missed it by inches. Then I tried fitting this on my Saturn Vue. Now this is important, because the Vue is geared towards women whom have small hands, ergo the steering wheel is smaller and skinnier. So you would think the Vue is a perfect candidate...NOPE. I wrestled with the installation and would described it like sparring with a bear. After 10mins (not including breaks) I finally got the thing on the Vue. The result was the leather had stretched so much, it literally developed permanent stretch marks. Also, like other's who have commented in their Feedback, the wrap only made it barely halfway around the grip of the wheel. So there are now two pressure points on my hands from the front and back seams of the wrap when gripping the wheel.I gave it a rating of three due to it's exceptional quality. It is well made in the sense that its leather is very thick and the seams are well stitched. If this was right-size for my application it would have rated it Five.Part of the poor fit was my fault since I didn't pay close enough attention to the specs and prior to ordering I should have measured my steering wheels for proper fit. I mistakenly assumed since I had two steering wheels and one that is especially skinny, that It wouldn't have been a problem fitting.Take proper care with the dimensions of 15 x 1.5  Measure the girth of your steering wheel with a seamstress measuring tape. If 1.5\" does not cover at least 70% of you steering wheel circumference and the wheel's diameter is great than 15 inches, you will be immensely disappointed or at the very least frustrated with the install.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Well made, but beware of your vehicle's dimensions", "unixReviewTime": 1344902400, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2012"}

It is  gentle, effective and provides the best shine possible, whether your car is nearly new or has 100,000 miles on it.My daily driver is an original owner, 18 year old, bright red M3, and it still turns heads because it still looks great - thanks in part to regular use of 3M hand glaze.  Here's what you do - wash your car well, using one of the better car wash solutions like Meguiar's hi-tech wash or P21S car shampoo.  Dry.  Then use Griot's Garage (or similar) paint cleaning clay to remove surface contaminants and start to work on the swirls and other imperfections in your paint.  (You can skip this step, but I've recently discovered this cleaning clay and it really does wonders, especially on cars that spend a lot of time in the woods where birds, bugs and tree sap are unavoidable).Now - get out the 3M Imperial hand glaze.  This stuff is very finely abrasive and supremely gentle on your paint - clear coat or not. Use a terry or foam applicator pad to rub the glaze into the paint and rub out fine swirls and scratches.  Work on a small section of the car at a time -- perhaps a square foot or so of surface. Always buff the glaze off, before it dries, with a best quality cotton or microfiber polishing cloth.When you're done with the 3M hand glazing process, your paint will be at its best - silky smooth and contaminant free.  It will shine as best as it knows how - but you're not finished.  This is a polish, not a protectant wax.  So now's the time to protect the paint with a high quality wax - I recommend P21S carnauba or one of the Zymol paste waxes.Follow this regimen, do it two or three times a year and keep your car washed in between.

Under a magnified florescent work lamp, I lightly ground the three crescent-shaped, spring-loaded clamps that grab the grease fitting, careful to maintain the original contour. This took about two minutes. I'd lightly graze all three clamps and then test the connection. I left the coupler a little tight allowing for future wear. This grease gun is top quality. After a two-minute modification, it is now a customized tool. Guys like to customized cars, motorcycles and guns, why not their tools?

The paint was not in too bad a shape as I always used the 2 bucket hand wash method. Just light swirling on my grabber blue paint. To prepare the surface I washed the car then used Meguiar's clay bar to remove any embedded matter in the paint. Surprising what is in there after only 2 years even though the paint looked clean to the naked eye. After the claying I got out the Porter Cable polisher. Since this is an orbital polisher it is good for anyone who is new to using a power tool on your paint. This was my first time. It was quite simple actually. I mentally divided the hood into 5 section and did one at a time putting an X pattern on the Meguiar's polishing pad with the #9 Swirl remover. I did 4 section passes on each area and then used a microfiber towel to take off the excess polish. I could immediately see that the pad I used (Meguiar's 6.5-Inch Soft Buff Foam Polishing Pad) was just enough to do an excellent job. You see, since the paint was only 2 years old I didn't need a too aggressive polish, or a pad that cut too much. So if your car is in similar condition this may be a good combination for you. This I guess is why you do a test are first and not the whole car. After I was satisfied that this was the right combination, I moved on and finished the car. If it did not do the trick, I could use more pressure, a more aggressive pad, ramp up the speed on the polisher (I used setting 5 for this) or maybe bought a more aggressive polish. I really liked this stuff. Quite easy to do and I wasn't afraid that the polish would burn through my clear coat. I finished it up with Meguiar's liquid Ultimate Wax.

The towel came out more black than with other products, which I assume indicates it is removing a lot of oxidized black rubber/trim.Unfortunately, this product does NOT last.  I covered all the rubber/plastic on my car (two thorough coats), let it soak in/settle for a day, then washed it to get the overwipe/streaks of nearby body panels, etc.  The Meguiar's #40 washed completely off.  It was left worse than before I used the product.  The finish remaining was also very splotchy and looks bad.  Even some interior parts that I applied #40 to were mostly wiped clean after just wiping with a damp towel used to pick up accumulated dust/dirt.  It remained splotchy where there were minor nicks scratches in the plastic/rubber where more #40 had absorbed.Overall, I was very unsatisfied with the results.  I'm not going to say it is the worst product I have ever used, but others that I use are far and away better.  These include 303 Aerospace Protectant which is a very mild, water-based product which also doesn't last but is better than this Meguiars product and has almost no sheen.My previous staple and which I recommend most is actually Armor All Original.  I purchased a Guru Reports analysis on these types of products several years ago and was surprised that this \"old\" product was one of the two best-in-category products (along with Zaino) among over 50 that were tested.  Armor All Original (not other formulations) is very low sheen and also lasts several washes.  It is also about 1/4 the price or less and available everywhere.I'm going back to Armor All Original and recommend that you try it as it performs better than \"boutique\" products.  I would also recommend that you use water-based products on permanent trim, rubber, etc., as the solvent/petroleum-based ones have a tendency to degrade the rubber/plastic over time.  These may be OK for replaceable items like tires or parts that are severely oxidized.  You can generally tell the difference in that water-based products are milky color while the petroleum-based ones are clear.

When i was young, i knew no better, so i would take a screw driver and stab it through one side then to the other and use the screwdriver for increase of torque! hahaha It was tough... a bit funny, and really really messy. but now i never have to deal with that again.

I can't just push or lift my selector valve to operate it.  No, I have to twist it while pushing/pulling like a madman, and hope I don't break anything (including my fingers).

It's just a poor-fitting device.The tube connector where the main evacuation tube enters the top of the unit leaked when I put it in dispense mode.  I had to pay over $27 to get a replacement \"Tube Connector Kit\" (822566), since my unit is out of warranty.After replacing the tube connector and trying dispense mode again, I found that the top plate leaks.

When I use it in dispense mode now, the main tube doesn't leak anymore, but air and oil come out from under the top plate.  I removed the top plate, and sure enough, \"Look Ma, no seal!\"  It would be bad enough if the seal had merely failed, but for the seal not to be included in the first place is inexcusable.  Because I didn't notice this problem sooner, the seal (822821) is costing me an additional $13, including a ridiculous $8.75 fee for shipping.Now I've added (not replaced--added) the top seal, and while doing a test, I can hear that the unit leaks air at the top of the pump assembly.

So far so good.Next, I tested the refilling capability by returning the antifreeze back into the one gallon container.  It did this quickly and very throughly leaving only about 1 oz in the botton of the reservoir.

For my Crown Vic, and my pre-80's cars, it's simply outstanding.It pulls an amazing amount of oil from the pan, just have to fish around a little with the hose after you get most of the oil out, in order to find any small pockets of oil remaining.  After about 3-4 minutes of suction, I removed the drain plug and checked.  I only got a tablespoon or so of drip, which is pretty good, overall.  Transmission oil is just as easy, but I think you'd be better off slightly elevating the front/rear/side in order to force fluid toward the dipstick because the pans are usually flatter/shallower.Quick, easy, and you can just pump it right back into the empty oil container.  You're still going to get some on you...Finally, my one complaint, there is no way to securely fasten the hose and adapter fittings to the pump when it's not in use.  Minor, but irritating, since the little friction clip is pretty much useless if you bump the hose out.  The fittings disappeared into the garage somewhere, since I set them aside while I pumped out the oil.

Although I am well experienced with cars, I currently have my oilpan drain plug replaced with a temperature sensor, so I prefer not to remove that and risk damaging, plus, I hate having to get under the car and pray not to spill oil everywhere.The Pela pump was great, the big issue was that there was no easy way to drain the container and if you weren't careful, while draining you would tip too far and cause an air bubble which made oil dump out with some force and splash everywhere (think of turning a 2liter bottle upside down).  Unfortunately I had to toss out the pump because it was starting to leak some oil out of the handle.I read some great things on automotive forums about the Mityvac, and was ecstatic to find this particular model that can not only pump, but easily evacuate fluid as well.  This comes in real handy when dealing with fluids such as brake fluid and transmission fluid.  On top of that, it provided me a VERY easy way to extract oil from the pump back into the bottles ;).The pump worked like a charm, and did exactly what it is intended to do.  This is great for my car because although the car holds about 5 quarts of oil, conventional draining from the pan only drains out about 4 quarts as oil is still left in the oil coolers.  Because of the vacuum that this produces inside of the oil sump, I manage to evacuate almost every drop of oil from the system.One note is that you MUST tighten the screws holding on the top cover.

It includes everything you need and works pretty well, although sicking up 4-5 quarts can be a little slow, so be patient. I use it for oil changes so I don't need to always undo the drain plug and replace the compression washer (don't forget to replace the filter too!). I've heard so many horror stories about damage to the threads on the oil pan drain plug from over tightening that I decided to reduce the number of times I go there. That's where this Fluid Evacuator comes in. Warm up the engine a little, turn everything off, slip the straw like hose down the dip stick hole and suck up the oil. Change the filer and refill the oil and you're done. For me that means I don't have to remove panels under the car to access the oil pan drain plug and I don't have to put the car up on stands. Those both take a lot of time, so this evacuator is a great time saver. The tank is big enough to hold the oil from my larger car's engine and when the tank is full, the Mityvac can be put into reverse and pump out the contents too, so you don't need to pour out the tank.It includes several different diameter &#34;straws&#34; that are designed to slip down the dipstick hole or other filler holes (like on a differential). Those straws connect to clear piping so the Evacuator can be standing on the garage floor.Remember that oil and similar liquids flow best when warm. However, don't get the fluids hot and don't run the motor with the straw inserted! I read about someone who did that and the meshing gears pulled the straw into them, causing the motor to stall and needed to take apart the engine to get the straw out!!About my only complaint with the Evacuator is I wish it had more strays since I'd also like to drain the radiators using this but don't want to use the oily motor oil straw where oil isn't wanted in the radiator. Otherwise this is a great tool to have available.

They did NOT come with aiming instructions, which seems silly, if you ask me (but, who asked me, right!).If you've ever searched the web for headlight aiming instructions, good luck! No two are alike! I contacted the manufacturer of the bulbs, and even they had vague instructions. This is the best explanation I found: [...]Step one ... put some gas in the tank. The adjustment will fluctuate a little depending on how much gas you have in the tank (yes, I did it on empty the first time and had to re-adjust the height.), and other load/spring/shock conditions.On a flat surface, you drive the car as close as you can up to a wall and mark the center of the headlight beams. This varies from bulb to bulb, and can range from a well defined rectangle, to a somewhat defined \"top,\" and a vague \"bottom.\" Some bulbs have a kind of a \"z\" that you align where is zigs and zags.Now, back your vehicle up 25'. This is an \"industry rule of thumb,\" not a mystery, as some manufacturers may have you believe. My lights were shining on the ground at this point, waaaay off!On the back of your lights are little screws with 4 mm hex heads. The top ones towards the outside of the car are for up and down, the lower ones, towards the inside of the car, are for left and right. I tried pliers ... no good, I tried that little crescent wrench ... no good, I went to Sears and bought that pretty miniature set of metric wrenches that goes down to 4 mm for $20 (what was I thinking) ... and I was actually able to do some adjusting by turning and turning the wrench, back and forth, back and forth, dropping it into the frame ... (you know what I'm talkin' 'bout!) ... I did discover (if you're short of cash and have a little wrench already) that by taking the yellow bulb assembly out of the headlight, that the little wrench will spin around without taking it off the post.Since my daughter and I both have these cars, I decided to look for a \"real\" adjustment tool and found this Lisle product. WOW! Now, I can do BOTH headlights, up and down, AND, right and left, in the time it took me to do one screw before! This thing fits perfectly, it ratchets smoothly, and you can pop it on and off easily! It's like a miracle tool! NOTE TO SELF!!! DO \"NOT\" BACK THE ADJUSTER SCREW ALL THE WAY TO THE METAL PANEL BEHIND IT WITH THE TOOL ON THE SCREW! THE TOOL WON'T COME OFF AND YOU CAN'T REVERSE THE TOOL OTHER THAN TO REMOVE IT FROM THE SCREW AND TURN IT AROUND! And, no, I didn't actually do this, but I came darn close!K, I digress, sorry about that! Now, you have your car backed up 25' from the wall, hood open, radiator access panel removed (there's a little thumb screw you turn if you're lucky). Lights on \"low beam,\" then cover one of the lights with a dark towel or something, and it will be easier to see the light you're working on.Vertical adjustment (up and down) ... At this point there are several variations of \"the rule.\" I have found on my car that aligning the \"top\" on the headlight pattern at, or just below, the horizontal centerline for the lights that I marked on the wall is good. This is pretty easy to see for any of the bulbs that I have been using.Horizontal adjustment (side to side) ... This varies a lot! The recommendations in the link in this post has you align the \"driver's side\" of the beam rectangles (this varies from aligning the centerline of the beam rectangles to two inches to the right of the centerline in some recommendations, and various other recommendations), just up to the vertical centerlines that we marked on the wall. IF you can actually see a definite outline of the beans, this might work. On one car, the beams are defined, on the other I can NOT see a defined left or right edge on the wall, so I had to \"play it by ear\" and eyeball the adjusters so as to not get them too far in or out, erring on what I thought to be aiming the beams more to the passenger side of the centerlines. Keep in mind that the goal is to illuminate the shoulder, passenger side of the road, the lane you are traveling in, and, I believe, to illuminate somewhat, the oncoming lane without blinding the other driver.Commonsense, and a test drive will tell you if you have it right. If the street signs are glowing like the sun from a mile down the road, you're aimed too high! A quick check of the high beams while in front of the wall may verify your aim. You do NOT adjust high beams, they are supposed to be \"self-aiming\" when the low beams are aimed, however, they should be somewhat centered over those centerlines we marked earlier.The glory of this tool was then, when I did the test run with the radiator access cowling off already, and I could see the beam was too far towards the driver's side (middle) of the road, I just pulled off the road, opened the hood and popped the adjusting tool on the screw, easily flipped it a few turns (you will know which way after you adjust it a few times) and it came out perfect!Please verify all information, this can be dangerous for everyone if it's not done correctly.

A number of people say the gauge on this is too small.  I don't think the numbers on the gauge are much smaller than on the ARB Blue, but the Milton's gauge does feel harder to read.  I think it has more to do with the gauge being deeply inset behind thick glass/oil so light doesn't penetrate quite as easily as on the ARB's gauge, and the fact its measurement line is silver metal instead of bright red like the needle in the ARB's gauge.  Using a silver metal line is just stupid because it's a low contrast against a white background and black text and the silver partly reflects white light depending on how light strikes it making it even harder to see.  I think whoever designed this gauge \"back in the day\" decided it was somehow perfect and never needed any tweaks despite user complaints and other companies coming up with some better ideas.The junction between the red hose and gold pipe rotates which is nice if you want to push the filler against the tire at a convenient angle and still read the gauge.  The ARB doesn't have that feature which can leave its gauge hard to read because on a lot of tires you can only clip the hose on at a certain angle.One of the reviewers said the gauge measured pressure as you filled the tire, but that isn't true.  The gauge goes to zero while you fill, just like every other tire filler I've ever used, and only measures when you're not filling.  The gauge itself measured an identical value to a hand-held gauge I've been using forever.The description says the Milton has a \"dual chuck\" which I thought maybe meant you could rotate the silver end to press either side to the tire and one side might be made to connect to a different style of air connection.  But the silver part does not rotate and the air connection on both sides is identical.  I got the impression from another review that having a connection on the other side is useful if you have to push the hose into a tight space and pull the chuck back onto an air connection.The ARB comes with a type D quick disconnect already screwed in but on the Milton you have to supply your own sealing tape and screw in your own quick disconnect (ieLegacy A73457D Color Connex Type D 7 Piece 1/4 in. Red Coupler and Plug Kit).The ARB has a button you can use to release pressure from what you're inflating but the Milton has no such feature.  I don't think it's at all difficult to release some pressure on the chuck and just let air escape from the tire and that's probably easier than using a pressure-release button anyway.  Plus having a button creates another point that can fail during manufacture or after you've owned the tool for awhile.Despite the shortcomings, the Milton is much more solidly constructed than the ARB and the hose doesn't leak.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Gauge a little hard to read, great otherwise", "unixReviewTime": 1354060800, "reviewTime": "11 28, 2012"}

I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps.

I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Mothers Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes. Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat. Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome if they have stains.After the claying step I wax the car is small sections using Carnauba Wax. It easy to work with.  I put it on a small section (each side of the car is done in 4 sections, for example), by the time I am done spreading it, it is ready to be wiped off, you don't have to wait.  I use micro fiber towels to wipe the wax, using a fresh piece of the fiber on each section.As my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface. Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.Carnauba Wax gives a superior shine.

Since then, the car has set under the carport, uncovered, collecting dirt and grime. Its only use has been to serve as our cats \"perch\". You can hardly imagine how tired and run-down it looked. Truthfully, I was skeptical... but a friend who does auto detailing told me to give the Mothers three-step product a try. So based on that recommendation, I ordered it through Amazon as it was not available locally. I was excited to see what the old buggy could look like.I soon found out one thing - This product takes a lot of rubbing. After rinsing the car off (it doesn't run yet, so I just sponged it off) to get the worst of the grime off, then set to work with the cleaner. I also purchased the Mothers 4 Paint ball and used that in my drill along with lots of rubbing with some old fluffy athletic socks.First coat done: and the results were nothing short of amazing; However, some haze was still visible. So I applied a second coat of cleaner. That one went on much easier, and following the final hand rub, the haze was gone.I wish that I could post photos here for you to see the before and after - Only photos could demonstrate what this product, preceded by the step 1 cleaner, and step 2 sealer has done.Since the car had been virtually unprotected for nearly 30 years, and exposed to wind, temperature extremes, and blowing rain and snow, there were quite a few surface rust bubbles peeking through the paint. They still remain (after all, it's an old car with completely original paint). But that's okay - The Mothers three step product did its job and I am a happy camper.The only recommendation I would have is to buy two bottls of cleaner if you have a car in a similar condition. I ran short and had to buy a second bottle. In my mind, that's a small price to pay.The system is also available as a complete 3-step kit called the Ultimate Wax System.

It's a Cadillac CTS, and the only black areas are around the front and rear fascia, and the door pillars. But these black plastic parts had begun to fade after about 2 years. The car is even garage kept most of the time. Many of the black trim restoring products on Amazon have a wide range of reviews; from 1 to 5 stars for most if not every similar product. I chose Mothers because I use many of their other products, typically with good results. Back to Black did not disappoint. I applied it to the plastic trim around the fascia using \"12pcs Waxing Polish Wax Foam Sponge Applicator Pads Fit for Clean Car Vehicle Auto Glass High_quality Yellow Useful NEW\" (from Amazon) which are ideal for this task. Mothers instructions state that the area should be buffed after application. I found buffing unnecessary on the trim around the fascia. I did try buffing at first, but these areas are somewhat rough-textured and seemed to absorb the liquid fairly quickly. Buffing did not change the appearance.However, on the door pillars, the texture is smooth and buffing did make a appreciable difference there. Buffing with a soft towel helped to more evenly distribute the Back to Black, eliminating some minor streaking resulting from application. Buffing also improved the gloss of the black color, which would have been more like flat black prior to buffing. So whether to buff or not depends on the type of material where the product is being applied. Back to Black is also very good at removing any excess wax that gets on the fascia trim areas.Most of the negative reviews of this and similar black detailing products are because they need periodic reapplication. I found this to be true also of Back to Black. But no black detailer is going to be a miracle product and last forever.

After washing and drying, and applying Mother's back to black I am thoroughly satisfied.

A couple of things impressed me, it really evened out the blemishes and brought all the trim to a consistent black color.  This was extremely evident around the bed of the truck where part of flat areas are expose and some flats areas are protected by deck lids (on the various compartments), which when opened revealed a sharp line between the two areas.  After applying back to black you could not tell the difference, the trim was even in color and shine. It looked brand new...  Impressive, indeed.But just to say out loud, it's important to work back to black into the sun baked dry parts.  if it is really dry, like mine was, you may have to hit it several times.  That's the key, get the rag saturated with the product and keep working it in until the trim cannot absorb any more.  Once you've reached that point, go back with a clean dry towel and wipe off the excess and buff it so that the shine is in the trim and not from the excess product on the trim.  Don't go by sight, feel the trim with your hand until there is no excess product on it... keep drying and buffing until the trim shines on its own.  If you don't, you'll get streaking.

Since then, the car has set under the carport, uncovered, collecting dirt and grime.  Its only use has been to serve as our cats \"perch\".  You can hardly imagine how tired and run-down it looked.  Truthfully, I was skeptical... but a friend who does auto detailing told me to give the Mothers three-step product a try.  So based on that recommendation, I ordered it through Amazon as it was not available locally.  I was excited to see what the old buggy could look like.I soon found out one thing - This product takes a lot of rubbing.  After rinsing the car off (it doesn't run yet, so I just sponged it off) to get the worst of the grime off, then set to work with the cleaner.  I also purchased the Mothers 4 Paint ball and used that in my drill along with lots of rubbing with some old fluffy athletic socks.First coat done: and the results were nothing short of amazing; However, some haze was still visible.  So I applied a second coat of cleaner.  That one went on much easier, and following the final hand rub, the haze was gone.I wish that I could post photos here for you to see the before and after - Only photos could demonstrate what this product, followed by the step 2 sealer, and step 3 carnuba wax has done.Since the car had been virtually unprotected for nearly 30 years, and exposed to wind, temperature extremes, and blowing rain and snow, there were quite a few surface rust bubbles peeking through the paint.  They still remain (after all, it's an old car with completely original paint).  But that's okay - The Mothers three step product did its job and I am a happy camper.The only recommendation I would have is to buy two bottls of cleaner if you have a car in a similar condition.  I ran short and had to buy a second bottle.  In my mind, that's a small price to pay.The system is also available as a complete 3-step kit called the Ultimate Wax System.

It did a good job, smelled nice, and left the car clean.  But as I am always looking for a better shine, I decided to give the Mother's Instant Detailer a try, and I'm glad I did.  Indeed, until I decided to try the Mother's product, I assumed that all \"instant detailers\" were pretty much alike. Not so!  In my experience, the Mother's product not only cleans the car but it also produces greater shine, depth and gloss. It also seems to brighten the finish as well.  My take: it's a superior product.Mother's Instant Detailer is very mild, it smells great, and makes a noticeable difference in a car's appearance. I no longer use the other brand.Since discovering Mother's Instant Detailer I have tried a number of other Mother's wax products, and found them to be at least a notch or two above the current offerings of the major retail store competitors.

Since then, the car has set under the carport, uncovered, collecting dirt and grime.  Its only use has been to serve as our cats \"perch\".  You can hardly imagine how tired and run-down it looked.  Truthfully, I was skeptical... but a friend who does auto detailing told me to give the Mothers three-step product a try.  So based on that recommendation, I ordered it through Amazon as it was not available locally.  I was excited to see what the old buggy could look like.I soon found out one thing - This product takes a lot of rubbing.  After rinsing the car off (it doesn't run yet, so I just sponged it off) to get the worst of the grime off, then set to work with the cleaner.  I also purchased the Mothers 4 Paint ball and used that in my drill along with lots of rubbing with some old fluffy athletic socks.First coat done: and the results were nothing short of amazing; However, some haze was still visible.  So I applied a second coat of cleaner.  That one went on much easier, and following the final hand rub, the haze was gone.I wish that I could post photos here for you to see the before and after - Only photos could demonstrate what this product, followed by the step 2 sealer, and step 3 carnuba wax has done.Since the car had been virtually unprotected for nearly 30 years, and exposed to wind, temperature extremes, and blowing rain and snow, there were quite a few surface rust bubbles peeking through the paint.  They still remain (after all, it's an old car with completely original paint).  But that's okay - The Mothers three step product did its job and I am a happy camper.The only recommendation I would have is to buy two bottls of cleaner if you have a car in a similar condition.  I ran short and had to buy a second bottle.  In my mind, that's a small price to pay.I will be posting this same review under the step two and step three products to help anyone who may miss this particular review.

If I'm not mistaken it is either a very mild type of car polish and may contain abrasives. Basically it will smooth out your cars surface, and make it shiny from the clear coat surface. I think it did a fair job making it shine and removing surface residue from the clay and detailer. It did an okay job so far with very light swirlmarks. since I am unfamiliar with other polishing compounds that I have been hearing about I will give this product of 3.5 rounded to 4 stars. just because I like it enough for the ease of use/money/amount and ending result.

I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it.  I have toadmit that the car does look like new with much of the credit to regular claying and using back-to-blackon plastic parts.I should mention that I store Gold Clay in a plastic container which used to contain onion dip.  This keeps it pliable and clean.  It is a bit strange that the container for clay did not come with the package.  If clay dries out it will stop working. And it is sticky, so if you leave it without some sort of container it will pick up dirt that could scratch the car the next time you use it.Claying system removes contaminants that attach themselves to the car. Clay does not polish the car or remove any paint of finish, so it is totally safe to the finish if used properly (i.e. with plenty of lubrication).The clay material (which feels like play-doh)makes the small particulars that are deposited on the car finish attach themselves to the clay and get lifted from the car finish. Clay needs to be used with heavy lubrication, which Showtime Instant Detailer, included in this package, provides.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes.  Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat.  Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car.

Reinecke", "helpful": [137, 177], "reviewText": "I have a 1998 Ram pickup that spends its entire life outside, parked near trees.  I hadn't done much with paint care for more than a couple years and one side was covered in small, hard, brown tree sap spots.  Reading the reviews on Amazon (and other websites) for clay bars and their use in cleaning up paint surfaces, I thought I'd try this Mother's kit to revitalize my paint job.  I was sceptical about its abilities to do anything other than a final \"fine cleaning\".  I was right.The clay bar could not remove any of the hard tree sap marks.  It does not remove scratches (and can actually apply some if you do not keep the clay lubricated.  It does make the paint seem smoother to the touch, but I cannot tell the difference between a final normally waxed and polished surface and a clayed waxed and polished surface.  The surface feel of unpolished paint Vs clayed paint does exhibit a noticeable benefit from claying, as the makers claim.  However, applying a good polish achieves the same results on a washed and clean paint surface, in my opinion.  Even on my truck, after cleaning it first, the clay stayed pretty clean and only after doing the whole vehicle paint surface did the clay feel faintly gritty and appear slightly darker in color - ready for trashing.To remove the sap, I resorted to a rag soaked in mineral spirits and plenty of elbow grease.  To eliminate any light scratches, I used T-Cut.  Then I clayed it, followed by polishing with Turtle Wax.  After a day of that, my shoulders ached bad, but the truck paintwork looks good; well, as good as an 11 year old, well-used, stone-chipped and scratched truck can.  The clearcoat has actually held up exceedingly well over the years.I haven't tried clay on our 3 year old, garaged minivan yet.  It will be interesting to see if it removes minor swirl marks.  I don't expect it to make the paint look any shinier after polishing. It looks great as it is.I did buy an extra bottle of detailing spray (I bought the kit locally at Autozone) in case one wasn't enough.  But one was enough for one clay bar / one vehicle treatment.  Since there are two clay bars in the kit, then the extra bottle will be used with the second bar.I found the claying to be easy and quite quick.  I split the bar in two, then pressed it flat into a disc about 2\" in diameter.  Then I sprayed the surface and rubbed the clay back and forth over the paint in my palm.  Knead it regularly back into the 2\" disc, as it gets thinner and splits.  It was actually very straightforward and no big deal.  Avoid rubber parts, like the windshield surround, as the clay picked up black \"soot\" from those.  Make sure you polish it dry as the spray leaves streaks if you don't remove it with the supplied towelI suggest clay bars are really for the guys and gals that want the ultimate care for their newer vehicles.  It may not be noticed by anyone else, but it's the satisfaction of a job well done that always matters to the perfectionist!  I know 'cos I am one!Sept 26 2009 UPDATE:  This evening, I tried claying half the hood of my minivan then waxing it all to see if I could tell any difference.  The clearcoat on the van is in great condition.  I washed the hood and dried it.  Then I clayed the left half (LH as seated in the van).  I did notice that even with plenty of spray lubricant there were a few faint straight line, light scratches visible in the clearcoat after I wiped the surface dry that weren't there before claying.  I could not feel any real difference in the surface smoothness from the clayed to the unclayed side. The clay appeared to have no visible dirt in it.  I then Turtle Wax'd the whole hood.  After that, the straight line scratches were gone and there was no VISUAL difference from clayed to unclayed even with the reflected overhead flourescent light from my garage as a guide.  I then applied my dry finger tips to the hood; left hand on the unclayed side and right hand on the clayed side.  Applying a light pressure and sliding back and forth, I think I detected a slight reduction in friction as the fingers change direction on the clayed side.  Even swapping hands over, the result seemed the same, ruling out differences in my finger tips!  However, the effect was so slight that it was almost imperceptible.CONCLUSION:  Claying may help with a contaminated paint surface to remove those last little imperfections and revive the paint, but with a clean and regularly-waxed paint surface, claying probably isn't worth the cost nor the effort.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Claying is more for the perfectionist", "unixReviewTime": 1253750400, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2009"}

Plenty of the included spray detailer must be used or else the clay will stick to the car. I personally don't rub too aggressively, and I don't believe that is necessary. After the clay the residue is wiped away with a microfiber cloth. While you can leave the car as is, it is a really good idea to put on a coat of wax immediately after claying the car. You will be amazed at how smooth and slick the car's paint will be after just claying, and with the wax it'll feel like you greased the surface. The results can be incredible if you are patient and follow the directions. The only thing to remember is that if the clay bar ever falls on the ground it must be thrown away.

I once had a car assigned to me for two years, but other than that I've only had single day rentals.  So of course, in the honeymoon stage with my 2007 Honda Element, I wanted to make it look as beautiful as possible before showing it off to my family at Thanksgiving.So I went to a local pro detailer.  To hand wash and vacuum out the car it would be $25; to clay bar the car and do the wash it's $75; full detailing cost $150.  That's pretty decent, and I wouldn't mind paying to have the pro do the job, but for $18 I wanted to try clay barring it myself.The instructions couldn't be simpler, though I would add that you should at least rinse off the car and let it air dry for a few minutes before starting to clay bar.  You don't have to be particularly gentle or slow about it, and don't worry about getting the chamois dirty--you can wash it or just get another one for cheap.Just spray, rub, wipe it down with the cloth, and move on to the next spot until you've done the whole car.  Don't worry about getting into ever single little nook and cranny.  I imagine even the pros don't bother with that unless they're literally working on a showpiece.Trust me, you couldn't fail to be happy with the results, and for $18 why not try.When you're finished clay barring the car, take it to a car wash for a nice wash and wax (or do that yourself as well) and see the gorgeous results.  The car will look as new as it possibly could.Lastly, I want to dispell a myth about clay barring.  I heard--from a pro amongst others--that what clay barring does is reverse the oxydization of the paint which makes the finish dull, amongst other wierd science theories.  That's rediculous; car wax does that.  All clay barring does is pick up tiny bits of stuff--airborn metal specks, asphalt dust, microscopic bits of rock, space debris--which have become embedded in the paint.  That's it.  It's basically just removing the millions of tiny little splinters of stuff that have lodged themselves into the paint since it was new or the last time it was clay barred.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Requires no skill or experience whatsoever.

I will say that it does what it says: I tried it on a small part of my car to test it out, and it certainly smoothes the rough, presumably contaminated surface. You can hear and feel the crunchy layer being lifted away, and the paint is returned to a like-new slickness. The process also seemed to make for a much nicer finish after waxing. Count me as another believer in the power of clay.If I were you, reading this review and wondering if this is the right purchase for your first-time claying (I must have spent several hours Googling and browsing Amazon for info; I know what you're going through), I would want to be told this: Buy a separate clay bar, and use soapy water for lubricant. Use the saved money to buy a nice bottle of car wash.At first I was hesitant to use soapy water instead of the detailer spray that came with it, but after some research I discovered that many professional detailers use soapy water (there are YouTube vids with professionals using soap suds for claying). I even did a test at first, using soapy water on one area and the detail spray on another, and the clay process worked just as well with soap (or auto shampoo, rather). Just be sure the water is very sudsy and constantly applied. I wound up using the Showtime spray to clay about half the car, and I nearly used up the entire bottle. Maybe I used too much, but I only sprayed enough to cover the surface (a 2010 Accord), and with something like this I figure too much lubricant is better than too little. Detailing spray isn't exactly expensive, but using the spray instead of soap could easily result in adding $5-$10 to the task. If it offered better performance over soapy water, that would be one thing, but it doesn't seem to.Before washing the car I tried using the spray alone as a detailer on a lightly dusty surface, and it cleaned well. I wish I had just used soapy water for the entire clay process and saved the detail spray for its original purpose. In that sense, this kit is probably a nice value along with the microfiber cloth (also pretty nice quality). I can't comment on the quality of the clay bar since it's the only one I've used. It was soft and didn't fall apart. I didn't see the huge amount of contaminants on the bar like you see in some customer photos (hardly any, really, but maybe my contaminants were of the transparent sort), but it definitely had an impact on surface smoothness.It was a good learning experience and good value considering everything it comes with. However, in the future I'll buy a separate clay bar.

It seemed that the dirt and grime had gotten lodged in the paint and wouldn't budge no matter how hard I tried washing the car. After every car wash, I would run my fingers through the paint and it would still feel gritty.That was when I learned about Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit. The results were astounding! After using it, the paint no longer felt gritty but glassy-smooth. The paint was no longer dulled by contaminants and the car looked like it had a new coat of paint! I was immensely pleased with the results.Unlike a lot of car polish or polishing compounds that use abrasion to strip away surface contaminants, auto clay simply picks up surface contaminants and locks them into the clay. The clay looks and feels exactly like plasticine (Play-doh) and it is used along with the included \"lubricant\" spray (actually, an auto soap that provide lots of suds -- like Meguiar's Gold Class -- will work equally well.)Mind you, car polish still has its place in paint restoration because claying will not remove scratches; only a car polish or a polishing compound (harsher) can do that. And remember, always follow the claying with an application of wax to shield your paint from new contaminants. Also, clay your car every so often and you will keep the paint looking like new!I am giving Mothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System Kit my highest recommendation. Go on, try it and see for yourself firsthand the difference it makes in your car paint.

This worked, but it was pretty time consuming, and required a lot of care, so I decided to try Mothers California Gold clay bar kit.  The kit contains two bars of clay, a microfiber towel, and a spray bottle of Showtime Instant Detailer.I found that while the clay product does a pretty good job of removing dirt, sap, and small particles, adhering to the paint finish, it doesn't do much for removing paint spots.  For the uninitiated, using this product effectively requires developing a certain technique, particularly if you have a thick layer of gunk on your finish.Firstly, the surface you are treating should be cleaned of surface dirt, and cool.  The Instant Detailer spray is pretty slippery, and there is very little friction when sliding the clay bar across a surface sprayed with this stuff.  What you want to try to do is have a thin layer of the Detailer solution on the area, so you can slide the clay over the surface, but still get enough friction so the clay can pickup and remove particles from the finish.  If you have never done this before, it may take some trial and error to develop a technique that works.Since the clay is soft, it is constantly changing its shape as you use it, and from time to time, you will need to reshape it.  One thing to be very aware of, is not getting any debris into the clay.  If you accidentally drop the clay on the ground and happen to get a small rock, piece of metal, or other hard substance stuck in the clay, you could do some major damage to your finish, if you use the clay.  I store the clay in a small zip lock bag, and always be sure to have a zip lock with me when working, to try and keep the clay from picking up something that could be destructive.The bottom line is that the product works pretty well, but you will probably need to have a decent technique, and plenty of muscle to get the job done.  The process is not a simple spray on and wipe off, it will require some time and physical effort to do an entire vehicle.  The clay works on all kinds of finishes, but probably produces the best results on smoother finishes, as there is less friction.

About a month ago when I just finished my pre-winter car cleaning ritual a neighbor walked by and ask me if it was a new car shining in my drive way.  That's when you know the wax did its job well.Meguiar Gold Liquid Wax not only does a great job, it is easy to work with if you follow simple steps below:WASHI wash the car first using a detergent designed for car washing, as it removes the grime better. I use microfiber towels to wash.  What you use to wash makes a big difference, a good micro fiber towel makes the job go faster and it does a good job with the smallest amount of effort.BE COOLI wash either in the shade or in the evening when the sun is not strong. Strong sun will dry out the water too soon and working with dry finish can lead to small abrasions. Hot paint finish is also easier to damage. So I make sure the car is cool while I am working on it. I wash the top of the car, then the bottom of the car.  I don't want dirty water streaming down on the clean portions.DRYThen I dry the car which helps remove whatever dirt might have remained on the car after the wash.  I use more micro fiber towels.  I like Costco's micro fiber towel bag, for $10 you get a big bag of high quality towels of just the right size.CLAYI check the car for any dirt that the water did not take off and clay those areas.  I don't clay the entire car, just the areas where I see imperfections.WAXI apply the wax to another micro fiber towel, spread it on a small portion of the car (3 feet by 3 feet), then wipe it off with another micro fiber towel.  If you let the wax sit too long it will become difficult to buff off, that's why working on small areas is better.  If I drop a towel, I move on to the next one.  Even tiny dirt particles you can't see will scratch the paint surface.  I try avoid getting wax on plastic parts.  If I do get it on the plastic parts, see \"back to black\" described below.BACK To BLACKThe final step is to apply Back to black solution to plastic parts of the car.  It makes the plastic look new, and it is not harmful to the painted surfaces. Back to black solution effectively removes any wax residue you might have gotten on to the plastic parts, it also takes care of the sun damage to the plastic.This procedure takes me about an hour.

Inside the bottle is a very good wax that will greatly enhance your paint's finish, while providing all-important protection.For optimum results I strongly encourage you before you apply Gold Class, to clay your car, clean with a paint cleaner (i.e. Deep Crystal Step 1), polish with a pure polish (Deep Crystal Step 2 or #7 Show Car Polish), and then apply this wax. The results are truly remarkable. Again, I have used many waxes to top off my detailing, and Gold Class is one I keep going back to.  It's one of my favorites and one of the best.To maintain your shine, remove loose dirt and contaminants with Quick Detailer, or Ultimate Quick Detailer.Meguiar's keeps delivering the good stuff, and I'm a fan.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "One of Meguiar's Best = One of the Best Period", "unixReviewTime": 1219276800, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2008"}

Then I used Ultra Cut compound with Meguiar's DA polisher and Meguiar's 7006 cutting pad followed by Meguiar's Ultra Finishing Polish using the same DA polisher and Meguiar's 9006 pad.  I saw an impressive reduction in swirl marks and scratches.  The black paint looked almost like a mirror.  I could not remove every single scratch, but the paint looked much better than before and much better than paint on many seven year old cars.After Cutting and Finishing compounds, I applied Meguiar's Mirror Glaze and two coats of Meguiar's NXT was.

If you want to have a \"Wet Look\" paint finish, this can help you achieve that.  This is how I got my 3 year old car looking like a show car.1. Wash you car with Meguiars Car Wash.  Make sure to get all the dirt off.  Dry thoroughly.  I use a super absorbent chamois to speed up the process.  Make sure to do this in the shade.  The car's surface should be cool to the touch.2. Use the Meguiars Claybar. Keep going until your hand glides on top of the paint.  This will give your paint a glass smooth finish.3. Apply Meguiars Paint Cleaner with a Random Orbital Buffer or Meguiars Buffer.  This will remove any stains and very fine swirls.4. Apply this Mirror Glaze with the Random Orbital buffer.  Wipe off and buff using a Microfiber Cloth.5. Apply your choice of Meguiars Waxes with the Orbital buffer.  I personally prefer the Meguiars NXT wax because I dont have to wait long after applying the wax before I can wipe off and buff.6.  Maintain this new finish by using the Mequiars Ultimate Quick Detailer often to clean any dust,tree sap or bird droppings that may land on your car. The Detailer will keep it lookng great and also extend the UV protection.You just need to do this entire process once or twice a year.  Regularly, you just need to wash your car at least once a week.  And you can re-apply Meguiars wax once a month or as often as you like as their waxes do not damage your clear coat.

They're easy to line up, wide enough to provide confidence, and they seem plenty strong. They're light enough to be very easy to lift and move around.These ramps are not hollow shells; they have supports on the inside. Because of this, you cannot place one ramp inside the other for storage.It took a few times for me to get used to driving up these ramps.  Let's face it, driving up an incline in your garage is not something you are probably used to.  The second time I did it, my tires hit the raised lip on the ramp (the one designed to stop the wheels) pretty hard.  When it did this, it made a loud noise, and I suffered a moment of terror before I realized that nothing was wrong.I decided it would be much easier to drive up these ramps if I could see what I was doing.  So, I bought a cheap full-length mirror at Target (the kind designed to be mounted on the inside of a bedroom door).  Now when I use these ramps, I set the mirror down on my garage floor lengthwise, leaning against the wall, adjusted so I can see my front driver-side tire the whole time.  This has made it vastly easier to drive up the ramps with confidence--and without killing my transmission. The same trick also makes backing down the ramps easier. It's important to be going extremely slowly at the point when the tires leave the ramps and make first contact with the floor. If you're going too fast, the suspension will bounce, which (depending on the vehicle) could damage something when the underside of the vehicle hits the higher portion of the ramps.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice ramps", "unixReviewTime": 1297296000, "reviewTime": "02 10, 2011"}

I put them right up Against the tire, and then drove right on up!!!  The Negative is it's not UP very high, at least on my lowered truck.  On my Low to the ground creeper, I could just get under to change the oil and oil filter.  I wanted to change the Fuel filter also, but that was ALMOST impossible.  It's along the frame railing back a bit near the front of the Gas tank,  I could barley get back enough to just reach the filter and 2 wrench it with one hand to get the filter off.

Just squeeze a little onto a soft cloth, rub on the metal for a minute or two and buff off to a brilliant shine.HINT:  This polish works awesome to restore the lustre on many metals, but be careful when using this on items that are metal plated or made of lower quality metals because Simichrome will buff the metal right off of it.

I thought this might be the perfect thing to place in my old truck in the event I had a break-down. I also thought it might be good to take on my ATV trips in the event I break down on the trail and need to leave some kind of visible marker on my ATV along the trail.Sad to say, I was rather disappointed. The flare is powered by two AAA batteries and a single red LED. In the daylight, the light output from the flare is barely noticeable. At night-time it is slightly more noticeable and might serve as a marker light on your car to someone who is paying attention. Or, if you were using it on a dark trail, it might be visible from a short distance. But it really is no brighter than the keyfob LEDs that are intended to assist in unlocking a door. The light is also uni-directional (only coming from one side of the flare), so careful positioning would be a must. I think it would be tricky to use as a map light, too, since maps often contain red text which would be difficult to see with a red light.That said, I will not go as far as to claim that the product mis-represents itself. It is re-usable, and it could function as a secondary warning marker. It is not flammable, and it came with batteries which seems rare these days. The idea for the magnetic end that sticks to the sides of vehicles would be good, if most vehicles were made of steel. But many these days are made of fiberglass or aluminum and thus the magnet serves a limited purpose.If this product were marketed as a sort of a secondary marker light, it might be acceptable. One could place it on top of their car or on the trunk as a \"failsafe\". After all, the more lights the better. However, the idea that it would serve as a \"flare\" is just not correct.

Not just any plastic, but appears to be manufactured of the kind of hard plastic that quickly turns very brittle and cracks when exposed to the extreme temperature variations found inside a vehicle, which after all, is where this item is meant to be kept. While it is battery powered, and doesn't really pose any kind of roadside fire hazard, its usefulness is severely limited.First of all, one has to rely on always having it loaded with good batteries. Dead batteries do noone any good, and I've found most people just throw items like this in the trunk or glove box, and forget about it, not really thinking to check the batteries regularly.But does it work? Well yes, sort of. The unit has a small lens powered by an LED that either blinks on and off, or lights up continuously. The continuous on is meant for a low-glare map light, while the blinking feature is meant to capture the attention of oncoming motorists. Unfortunately, the LED is not very bright, and is likely to go unnoticed from anyone farther away than 15 to 20 yards, and is so small and low intensity that even if noticed, it is doubtful anyone would recognize it as a hazard or warning beacon. While we certainly don't want anything so bright it blinds oncoming drivers, we also don't want something so dim that it doesn't trigger anyone's warning instincts soon enough.Interstate highway? Forget it, buy some reflective triangles. Rural highways? Not much of a chance of being seen in time at highway speeds. Well lit neighborhoods? It likely won't get noticed. From my perspective, about the only time a unit like this would attract any attention is if it was on a poorly lit rural backroad where the speed limit is 35 mph or under, and there are no other lights in the area to cause any distraction or overpower the weak light source this unit provides.

Depending on how you insert this extension into your vehicle (hole one or two), and how you insert your bike rack or whatever else into the &#34;female&#34; end (hole one or two), there is some adjustment on how much extension you achieve.  In theory.I was hoping to use the SMALLEST amount of extension with this so that I'd achieve about 7&#34; of extension.  I needed to extend my Thule T2 bike rack just enough to clear a larger-than-factory Jeep tire.i am able to use the hole that positions this extension furthest into my Jeep (so the &#34;male&#34; of this extension is adjustable).  Unfortunately, I was not able to utilize the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; end of this extension because there is only about 2&#34; of space between that deeper hole and an internal ridge where the inside square bar is welded to the outside square bar.  Hard to describe, but essentially my Thule bike rack it the back of this extension before the holes lined up with the deepest hole in this extension.So.. I suppose you could blame that on my bike rack?  In hind sight though, I wouldn't trust any bike rack that only had that little amount of metal behind the holes--just not enough there to handle the load.  No.. I think that this extension could have been better designed to just have ONE hole on the &#34;female&#34; end, but position it somewhat in-between the two that it currently has.  I doubt that there are many racks out there that could utilize the deepest hole in this extension's &#34;female&#34; side...One additional comment.. I read some reviews that criticized the welds.  I am not a welder, but in my observation, the welds seem smooth and uniform all the way around this.  I must say that the metal is a little thin compared to other extensions that I've seen.  I think it's quite fine for any 2-bike rack out there, and I'm using it for that.  When I set up to carry 4-bikes, I do worry that this may snap though, and I am pursuing another extension for that reason.Conclusion:  If you are only carrying 2 bikes, and you are happy with the extension possibilities IGNORING the deepest hole in the &#34;female&#34; part of this extension, I recommend it.  The price is reasonable and the integrated locking bolt is really nice (especially if you buy their optional locking bolt.)If you want a very short extension, this probably won't work.If you plan to carry 4 bikes, I don't know if this is strong enough.

Problem is that diameter of the plastic ring that holds the screw covers is too small to take the screw's large diameter head. The maximum screw head diameter that will fit the ring is .435 inch (11 millimeters). Option 1: Replace the nylon retainers on the car, but different cars have different retainers so one must search for new ones that will accept a #12 screw. Option 2: Try to find #14 self-tapping screws with smaller heads. I shopped around for #14 screws with smaller heads to no avail. Option 3: Grind down the screw head's diameter. Option 4 (not good): On one car I used #12 sheet metal screws that have a smaller diameter, but DO fit the rings, and wrapped the threads with tape. This sort of works, but I really can't tighten them down satisfactorily. So I have to check their security now and then. I'm leaving the other car as is for now. Maybe someone has more practical ideas? Sure would like to hear of them. BTW, SEE THE UPDATE BELOW.UPDATE 11/16/13:I think I've found a viable solution to the above problem. I used a #12 sheet metal self-tapping screw, placed a 1/2-inch long piece of ordinary shrink tubing (1/4\" i.d.) over the threads towards the pointed end of the screw. Used a heat gun (or you can use a match, BIC lighter or soldering iron) to shrink the tubing which effectively increases the thread diameter to about that of a #14 screw. This allows me to tighten the screw securely and will last much longer than ordinary tape. One more thing: The THICKNESS of the screw head doesn't quite allow the chrome cap to fully snap into place over the nylon ring. The top of the head needs to be filed down a little leaving enough Philips \"X\" to use the screwdriver.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Some mounting screw head diameters are too large to fit the plastic rings.", "unixReviewTime": 1384041600, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2013"}

I reviewed a separate kit that came with the bolts and threaded plastic mounts for your bumper but that did not directly talk about the covers (I think, who can remember?). These covers and the clear plastic rings which allow the caps to be held in place are easy to install with the single exception that the holes in the clear plastic rings are almost always a little larger that the diameter of the bolts holding your plate in place. This creates the small problem of a chance to accidently crush the top of the ring as you re-tighten each bolt because the ring will sit low on the bolt threads causing the outer portion of the ring (which allows the cap to &#34;snap&#34; and be held in place) so that it falls under the back of the bolt head. So you'll need to slip the ring over the bolt head and you get near the end of tightening down the bolt. The only other problem I've had with these caps is that one cap in one set (new) split as I was snapping it onto the clear plastic ring. I had extras form an old set so no big deal.

Many of them claimed that the 20W-50 was designed for slow revving Harley-Davidsons with true V-Twins instead of the somewhat higher revving L-Twins from Ducati.I had clutch slippage with Rotella T6 5W-40, so I tried the M1 V-Twin 20W-50 because it is the only over the counter synthetic xW-50 JASO MA-compliant oil I can find outside the realm of boutique Motorcycle-specific oils from Motul or Silkolene at nearly double the price.The V-Twin 20W-50 is fairly thick out of the bottle, and my 696's engine starts up with a slow lumbering attitude and sound. I contacted Mobil to make sure they would recommend it, and they stated that the V-Twin 20W-50 was the correct oil to use in my 696. Once on the road, I didn't hear/feel anything wrong. WOT 9000 RPM upshifts were clean and precise. The datalogs I got from my Ducati Data Acquisition did not show any RPM spikes, and I did not hear the cat-like screeches after an upshift.As for the high-revving engine comment earlier, I looked up Buell's 1125 and Aprilia's RSV4 engine oil requirements. They both called for 15W-50, and Amsoil's catalog showed recommendations for 20W-50. The 1125 and RSV4 are by no means low revving engines, they can rev higher than most of Ducati's engines which are already fairly high at 9k-11k RPM.Overall: 5/5 stars, great oil to use if your bike needs 15W-50.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great oil to use for a bike that needs 15W-50", "unixReviewTime": 1332547200, "reviewTime": "03 24, 2012"}

I have never used Slime in an automobile tire, but since the materials are basically the same, I would assume that the product would work in a similar way.For an automobile, where the flat occurs makes a big difference.  If your car is parked and notice your tire is flat, this kit would probably be quite useful.  You can at least use the compressor to pump up the tire and check how bad the leak is.  If it is a fast leak, you can try using the Slime and see if it takes care of the problem.  The car does not need to be jacked up to use the product.If the puncture happens when the car is being driven, the problem is more serious.  When you drive on tire that is significantly deflated or flat, most times you will do heavy duty damage, or tear the tire.  If that happens, Slime won't help.  The tire will need to be replaced.  The instructions state that Slime will not work on punctures greater than 1/4 inch.  So basically, Slime is intended to address only minor tire damage.The Smart Spair kit is a pretty good deal.  It consists of a 16 ounce bottle of slime, and a compressor which plugs into the lighter outlet.  According to the label, a 16 ounce bottle, should be adequate to treat one averaged sized tire.  The 16 ounce bottle is available at Amazon for about nine dollars.  Subtract this cost from the price of the kit, and you are getting the compressor for less than fifteen dollars, which is not a bad deal.  The compressor has a pressure valve, ten foot cord, and on/off switch.  It is pretty noisy, and seems to have a reasonably quick pump rate.  It is rated for use on a minimum 15 amp circuit.  Some older cars have lighter circuits rated at only 8 amps, so you may want to check this before you buy.Hopefully I will not have to use the Smart Spair.  Based on the good (though limited) experience I have with Slime, I thought it would be good to have around, just in case.  There are many situations, where changing a tire at the side of the road, can be hazardous.  A kit like this could be valuable to those that are not capable of, jacking up their vehicle and changing the tire.

Take it home after the wash and clay bar the sucker (Meguiars makes the best clay bar kit). Then you can use their ultimate compound to make it even smoother or visa-versa.

The shine is not fantastic, but it is pretty good, and it is inexpensive. I am going to try a black crayon next, instead of the chip stick, just to see if it works as well. I bet it will.

Do not be afraid to complete a few extra passes with it. This is actually step 3 out of 4 steps. The first is to wash your car, then polish it, then clay bar the car, then use Megiuars Tech 2.0 polymer sealer. The clay bar step is actually effortless. You just have to remember not to drop the clay, and do extra passes/wipes, a small section (12&#34; x 12&#34;) at a time. The last few passes with the clay bar you can use the weight of the clay itself. One reviewer wrote that this was too mild and it did not remove a lot of contaminants. This is because he may be missing the &#34;polishing step&#34;. The &#34;contaminants&#34; should come off with the washing and polishing. The clay bar is for removing fine contaminants. Your paint will be very smooth and silky. That is no joke either; it really feels smooth. The car will then be ready for a polymer-sealant or a wax if you prefer.In Summary: Step 1 Wash your car with Megiuars Gold Class (better than the stinky yellow hazy Meguiars Ultimate Wash). Step 2 - Polish it with either of the following depending on the contaminants. Feel the paint. Is there a lot of grittiness ? Then you may want to use Megiuars medium/fine cut cleaner. The medium cut cleaner will remove some heavy duty water spots that you just cannot get out with anything else. If you do use the &#34;medium cut cleaner&#34;, then you may want to use a &#34;swirl remover&#34; after this step. If your paint feels all right (a small amount of grittiness), then a normal &#34;polish&#34; (Megiuars Ultimate Compound is great) will work just fine. Helpful hint. Purchase an inexpensive sponge, not a real loop sponge, one of those large smooth cheapy sponges for $1.75. If you use a round hand applicator, you may obtain a zebra stripe pattern. The zebra pattern means that the product is working, but your fingers are smashing down more than the applicator portion in between your fingers. You need an even pressure and your large cheapy sponge will achieve that. I also tried a large circular sponge applicator for my drill and that actually worked very well and it saved my arm a bit too. The circular applicator for my drill achieved the best results. I had major hard water spot damage that I just could not get out. Always remember that even though the paint appears very good after this step has been completed, do not stop at this step. There is no protection and your paint needs it since you just removed the protection. Step 3 - Clay Bar your car - use this kit or &#34;Mothers&#34;, although since I am writing a review in Megiuars product, use it. It works very well. Follow the directions. Use medium to light pressure. The last pass can be the weight of your clay and hand. I usually use 10-12 passes. Do not be afraid to make extra passes. The clay is really non-abrasive, and almost effortless to use. Complete the entire car. Do not drop the clay. If you do drop it there may be some grit hiding in the clay and you will scratch the heck out of your paint. I have used it after I dropped it, but it is a hassle removing the top layer of the clay that dropped. Step 4 - Waxing time - There are many many decisions to be made on this step. The different types of wax and sealants, paste wax, liquid wax will confuse even the most experienced car enthusiast. Do you enjoy waxing your vehicle every other week or once a month ? Then a very good quality Carnuba wax will work for you. Do you want the shine to last for 90 days or so ? The poly-sealant is right for you. Do you want to use a &#34;paste wax&#34; and enjoy a good workout for your biceps and triceps? Then a good paste wax is good for you. For me I want the shine to last for 90 days with minimal amount of effort to apply and remove. This is why I use Megiuars Tech 2.0 Wax which is technically not a wax at all, it is a synthetic polymer that shines very well. It will also last about 3 times longer than the carnuba wax and it is very easy to apply and remove. If you absolutely hate waxing your car and you do not mind the wonderful chemical smell, the once a year Nu Finish is actually a very good deal. It may not last a full year, but i tell you what, it is really close to it. I have used it and it works very well. It is also about $7 - $8 a can. Be sure to seal it up after you use it though, as it will age if you do not seal it up. But boy does it stink !!!

I've been washing and waxing my cars for 20 years, usually using a 3-step system (cleaner, polish, wax), and I usually get pretty decent results.  But I've heard so much about claying, I had to give it a try, and I'm glad I did.On my 2006 Honda Pilot with 100K+ miles, I washed and clayed first and was amazed at how much smoother the paint was.  I then tested a panel with Meguairs' Ultimate Cleaning Compound, and it did make an improvement, so I \"cleaned\" the car, then polished (Ultimate Polish) and waxed (Ultimate Wax), using an orbital polisher.  It took a few hours, but the results are astounding.  The paint is literally (not figuratively) smooth as glass.  I don't think it even felt like this when it was brand new.  The mirror finish is incredible.So if you've never clayed your car before, don't hesitate.  Just be sure to use lots of the included Quick Detailer for lubricant.I found the Meguiar's kit to be very good.  I broke off about 1/3 of the clay bar and that got me through half the car, then I used another 1/3 for the rest (including the windows).  So assuming that was the proper amount, I should be able to do 3 cars with the 2 bars in this kit.  Watch a few of the YouTube videos showing how to clay (including \"folding\" the clay when it becomes dirty) so you know exactly what to do.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Wow.

It seems strange and like a lot of work for you car, but both impressions were incorrect.After washing your vehicle with a safe wash, Claying your vehicle is the next step and a vital step.  Claying removes above surface contaminants on your paint's surface: bits of overspray, tar, etc. and lots of other things you can or more likely can't even see.  After washing your car, rub your flat hand across the surface. It won't smooth as glass. Furthermore, listen!  You'll hear your hand going back and forth over the surface as it rubs against the contaminants.  This is a car that needs to be clayed and just about any car if it has never been clayed needs to be clayed.  Even a brand new car on the lot often has contaminants.  Furthermore, once clayed, it's usually recommend to do it again every 3 months to a year, depending on the environment your car is in.  Honestly, claying your vehicle doesn't take a particularly long amount of time.  I'd say it's possible to do it in just under thirty minutes.The Smooth Surface Clay Kit from the wonderful folks at Meguiar's is the perfect kit to clay your vehicle.  Again, after washing your vehicle, spray an area with the Quick Detailer, and then use the clay bar across the surface.  You can search Youtube for Meguiar's Clay kit, to see demonstrations from users, but it isn't hard to do. Do a thorough job on your vehicle, and the way your hand then moves across the surface will impress you.  I'm amazed every time.After claying, you have several options.  The clay kit includes a sample of cleaner wax, and you can certainly use that. It has some mild cleaners and some protection.  However, if you use a cleaner wax, I'd recommend waxing the car more often as it isn't quite as durable as dedicated separate products.  Once a month for example with the cleaner wax, would be good.  Or, you could use the cleaner wax for its mild below surface cleaning properties followed by a more robust wax product such as Meguiar's Gold Class or NXT 2.0, and then you could potentially be set for a few months.If you want to do even more after claying, you can use a paint cleaner from Meguiar's for below surface contaminants right after claying, and then optionally a Pure Polish after that.  You'd top all that off with a wax such as Meguiar's Gold Class, or Meguiar's NXT 2.0.Furthermore, pick up more of the Quick Detailer, and you can use it to remove light dust and contaminants to your paint on a regular basis, and you can actually find you won't have to wash your vehicle as often.Whatever you choose, regular maintenance of your car's finish will keep you smiling for years to come. Meguiar's clay kit is a great way to start because not only does it make your finish smooth as glass, but it allows whatever wax you apply to adhere more evenly and properly to the surface, providing a better shine and longer lasting protection.A great product.
